# Flutter Bootstrap

Flutter Bootstrap is a design structure based on [Flutter Modular](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_modular).

# Packages

  - [mobx](https://pub.dev/packages/mobx)
  - [dio](https://pub.dev/packages/dio)
  - [i18n_extension](https://pub.dev/packages/i18n_extension)
  - [hive](https://pub.dev/packages/hive)
  - [path_provider](https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider)
  - [flutter_modular](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_modular)

# Features

  - Translation and Internationalization (i18n_extension)
  - Local storage (hive)
  - Decoupled state management (mobx)
  - Unit and Widget (UI) tests
  - Forms Validations
  - Basic decoupled components: Fields, Snackbar, Drawer, Buttons, etc.

# How it works

You can add, change or remove packages if necessary. Keep package versions always up to date.

Bootstrap Flutter starts with a login system using Firebase. To work, configure Firebase in your local project adding google-services.json and enable Email / Password authentication in your Firebase authentication method settings.
